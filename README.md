## Report
##### I chose to focus on the transportation sector for my project. There has been a significant increase in the measurement of CO2 emissions, which has resulted in environmental changes. 
##### The project involves creating a Machine Learning model that employs linear regression to estimate the level of pollution that a car engine could emit. 
##### Main focus is on utilising a Machine Learning approach to address the expected CO2 emissions resulting from vehicles.
##### I collected a large dataset containing diverse varieties of cars.
##### ML models to be used for prediction:
* Linear Regression
* SVR 
* Random Forest
* Lasso Regression

## Streamlit App
##### We've made a simple Streamlit App so we are able to see the result of our top two models.Â
