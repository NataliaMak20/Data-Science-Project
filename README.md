## Report
##### I chose to focus on the transportation sector for my project. There has been a significant increase in the measurement of CO2 emissions, which has resulted in environmental changes. 
##### The project involves creating a Machine Learning model that employs linear regression to estimate the level of pollution that a car engine could emit. 
##### Main focus is on utilising a Machine Learning approach to address the expected CO2 emissions resulting from vehicles.
##### I collected a large dataset containing diverse varieties of cars.
##### ML models to be used for prediction:
* Linear Regression
* SVR 
* Random Forest
* Lasso Regression

## Streamlit App
##### I have developed a basic Streamlit application that enables us to view the output of our best two models.
##### The initial page provides an overview of the content I wish to present, while on the left-hand side, I have a menu that allows you to switch between different models, view data, and observe the outcomes.

##### By utilizing rmse and r^2score, I can observe the outcomes of our models.
##### By analyzing these histogram and boxplot, I can obtain a precise understanding of the performance of our model.

##### In the video below you can see how the application works.
